 * Wordpress Pjax Support
 * @author Jake Teton-Landis <just.1.jake@gmail.com>
 *
 * load pages with history.pushState without re-rendering everything
 * @see https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax
 *
 * use the included pjax_get_header() and pjax_get_footer() functions
 * instead the the built-in Wordpress versions. Doing so will return
 * header-pjax-{header name}.php instead of header-{header name}.php
 * when the X-PJAX HTTP header is set
 *
 * Make sure your header-pjax has a <title> or a `data-title` attribute
 * if you want page titles to work.
